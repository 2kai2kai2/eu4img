EU4img
by 2kai2kai2

This is software for analyzing the save files for the game Europa Universalis IV. It uses the text file of the save (uncompressed) and 2 in-game screenshots (F10 in game) to create a summarizing png file that can be posted to a forum/discord.

Requirements:
Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Pillow 6.0.0+ (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

How to use:
Press F10 while on players mapmode to screenshot
Press F10 while on political mapmode to screenshot
Save (uncompressed) and exit
Run 'run.bat' or 'run.ps1'
When requested, add directory of files. This can be done by dragging the file into the terminal window
Wait. The final file will appear in the run file directory

Custom Font Instructions:
Put the .ttf file in the run directory as "FONT.TTF" (caps included)
The default eu4 font may only work on Windows. This is untested.

Updating:
Updated flags will be necessary when a new eu4 version is released.
