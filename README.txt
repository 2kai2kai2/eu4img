EU4img - Reservations
by 2kai2kai2

This is software for creating a map that shows all reserved nations (or otherwise marking all nations you want in 1444) intended for multiplayer games.

Requirements:
Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Pillow 6.0.0+ (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

How to use:
Run the program. You can add or remove countries via commands when prompted, then hit enter with nothing typed to continue. A map will be generated and shown in a text editor, in addition to being saved into the run directory (the folder with the files) as final.png . X's will be placed on the capitals of all marked nations in 1444. The placement may seem to be inaccurate, but this is because the X is placed on the location of the city (as shown in-game) of the capital province, meaning that the X may not be at the center of a province.

Updating:
Updated province data will be necessary when a new eu4 version is released.
