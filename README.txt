PIL

How to use:
Press F10 while on players mapmode to screenshot
Press F10 while on political mapmode to screenshot
Save (uncompressed) and exit
Run 'run.bat' or 'run.ps1'
When requested, add directory of files. This can be done by dragging the file into the terminal window
Wait. The final file will appear in the run file directory

Custom Font:
Put the ttf file in the run directory as "FONT.TTF"
The eu4 font only works on Windows
